	<h2>What is Skynet</h2>


	<p>Skynet is an open source Ruby implementation of Google&#8217;s Map/Reduce framework, created at Geni.com. With Skynet, one can easily convert a time-consuming serial task, such as a computationally expensive Rails migration, into a distributed program running on many computers.</p>


	<p>Skynet is an adaptive, self-upgrading, fault-tolerant, and fully distributed system with no single point of failure. It uses a &#8220;peer recovery&#8221; system where workers watch out for each other. If a worker dies or fails for any reason, another worker will notice and pick up that task. Skynet also has no special &#8216;master&#8217; servers, only workers which can act as a master for any task at any time. Even these master tasks can fail and will be picked up by other workers.</p>


	<h2>Installing</h2>


	<p>Skynet can be installed via RubyGems:</p>


	<p><pre class='syntax'><span class="ident">sudo</span> <span class="ident">gem</span> <span class="ident">install</span> <span class="ident">skynet</span></pre></p>


	<p>Since Skynet is a distributed system, it requires you have a skynet message queue as well as any number of skynet workers running.   Skynet workers need to boot with your code in order to run your jobs.   The easiest way is to install a skynet config file with skynet_install.</p>


	<p><pre class='syntax'><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">skynet_install</span> <span class="punct">[--</span><span class="ident">rails</span><span class="punct">]</span> <span class="punct">[--</span><span class="ident">mysql</span><span class="punct">]</span> <span class="constant">YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY</span></pre></p>


	<p>skynet_install installs a config/skynet_config.rb file into your application directory.</p>


	<p>If you pass&#8212;rails it will assume it is installing in a rails app.  If you pass&#8212;mysql it will assume you are using the mysql as your message queue.</p>


	<p>Edit this config file to include the libraries you want skynet workers to know about.  If you chose to install into a rails application the skynet_config.rb is already requiring your environment.rb file.  Now you can create your own Skynet jobs!</p>


	<h2>Starting Skynet</h2>


	<p>Once it is installed in your application, you can run skynet from your applications root directory with:</p>


	<p><pre class='syntax'><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">skynet</span> <span class="ident">start</span></pre></p>


	<p>This starts a skynet tuple space message queue and 4 workers.    You can control how many workers to start per machine
by passing&#8212;workers=NUMBER_OF_WORKERS.</p>


	<p>You can now run the skynet console to play with skynet a little.  See Skynet::ConsoleHelper for commands.
<pre class='syntax'><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">skynet</span> <span class="ident">console</span></pre></p>


	<p>Remember, when you change your code, you must stop/start skynet.</p>


	<p>For help try:
<pre class='syntax'><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">skynet</span> <span class="punct">--</span><span class="ident">help</span></pre>
or
<pre class='syntax'><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">skynet</span> <span class="ident">console</span> <span class="punct">--</span><span class="ident">help</span></pre></p>


	<p>Here are some commands you can run in the skynet console.
<pre class='syntax'>
  <span class="punct">&gt;</span> <span class="ident">stats</span>
  <span class="punct">&gt;</span> <span class="ident">manager</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">worker_pids</span>
  <span class="punct">&gt;</span> <span class="punct">[</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="punct">,</span><span class="number">2</span><span class="punct">,</span><span class="number">3</span><span class="punct">,</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="punct">,</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="punct">,</span><span class="number">4</span><span class="punct">].</span><span class="ident">mapreduce</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="constant">Skynet</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">MapreduceTest</span><span class="punct">)</span>
</pre></p>


	<p>That last command actually took whatever array you gave it and counted the number of times each element appeared in the array.  It&#8217;s not a very useful task, but it shows how easy it is to use.</p>


	<p>To see what Skynet is doing, you may want to tail the skynet logs being written to your log directory.</p>
