Skynet
</p>
<pre>
        http://skynet.rubyforge.org/
        by Adam Pisoni and Geni.com
</pre>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>
Skynet is an open source Ruby implementation of Google&#8216;s Map/Reduce
framework, created at Geni. With Skynet, one can easily convert a
time-consuming serial task, such as a computationally expensive Rails
migration, into a distributed program running on many computers.
</p>
<p>
Skynet is an adaptive, self-upgrading, fault-tolerant, and fully
distributed system with no single point of failure. It uses a &quot;peer
recovery&quot; system where workers watch out for each other. If a worker
dies or fails for any reason, another worker will notice and pick up that
task. Skynet also has no special &#8216;master&#8217; servers, only workers
which can act as a master for any task at any time. Even these master tasks
can fail and will be picked up by other workers.
</p>
<h2>DOCUMENTATION</h2>
<p>

specific examples. More specific documentation can be found here:

</p>
<h2>Map/Reduce</h2>
<p>
First of all, Skynet is merely a distributed computing system that allows
you to follow the map/reduce steps. You don&#8216;t have to use it as a
map/reduce framework. You can use it as a simple distributed system, or
even a simple asynchronous processing system.
</p>
<p>
If you already know what Map/Reduce is, skip this section.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know where all this Map/Reduce hype started, you should read
Google&#8216;s paper on it. <a
href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html</a>
</p>
<p>
When I first read that Google paper some years ago, I was a little confused
about what all the hypes was. At the most basic level, it seemed too simple
to be revolutionary. So you&#8216;ve got a job with 3 steps, you put some
data in, it gets split out to a map step run no many machines, the returned
data gets reshuffled and parceled out to a reduce step run on many
machines. All the results are then put together again. You can see it as 5
steps actually. Data -&gt; Partition -&gt; Map -&gt; Partition -&gt;
Reduce. Simple enough. Almost too simple. It was only years later when I
began working on Skynet that I realize what the revolutionary part of
Google&#8216;s framwork was. It made distributed computing accessible. Any
engineer could write a complex distributed system without needing to know
about the complexities of such systems. Also, since the distributed system
was generalized, you would only need one class of machines to run ALL of
your distributed processing, instead of specialized machines for
specialized functions. THAT was revolutionary.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of key differences between Google&#8216;s MR system and
skynet. Firstly, currently you can not actually send raw code to the
workers. You are really only telling it where the code is. At first this
bothered me a lot. Then I realized that in most OO systems, the amount of
code you&#8216;d need duplicate and to send over the wire to every worker
could be ridiculous. For example, if you want to distribute a task you need
to run in Rails, you&#8216;d have to send almost all of your app and rails
to every worker with every chunk of data. So, even if you COULD send code,
you&#8216;d probably only be sending code that just called some other code
in your system. If you can&#8216;t send ALL the code it needs, then you
might as well just tell it where the code is.
</p>
<p>
The second big difference is that Google&#8216;s MR framework uses Master
federater processes to dole out tasks, recombine them, and generally watch
the system. Skynet has not such masters. Instead Skynet uses a standard
message queue for all communication. That same message queue allows workers
to watch each other in the same way a master would, but without the single
point of failure (except the queue itself).
</p>
<p>
At its simplest level, a single map reduce job defines a data set, a map
method and a reduce method. It may also define a partition method. The
map/reduce server evenly splits up (partitions) the data given to it and
sends those chunks of data, along with a copy of the code in the map
method, to workers that execute the map method against the data it was
given. The output from each worker is sent back to the map/reduce server.
At this point the Mapreduce server evenly partitions the RESULT data
returned from the workers and sends those chunks of data along with the
reduce code to the workers to be executed. The reducers return the final
result which is returned to whomever requested the job be done in the first
place. Not all job need a reduce step, some may just have a map step.
</p>
<p>
The most common example of a mapreduce job is a distributed word counter.
Say you wanted to determine how many times a single word appears in a 1GB
text file. The map/reduce server would break up the 1GB file into
reasonable chunks, say 100 lines per chunk (or partition) and then send
each 100 line partition along with the code that looks for that word, to
workers. Each worker would grab its partition of the data, count how many
times the word appears in the data and return that number. It might take
dozens of workers to complete the task. When the map step is done, you are
left with a huge list of counts returned by the workers. In this example,
the reduce step would involve sending that list of counts to another
worker, with the code required to sum those counts and finally return the
total. In this way a task that used to be done in a linear fashion can be
parallelized easily.
</p>
<h2>INSTALLATION:</h2>
<p>
Skynet can be installed via RubyGems:
</p>
<pre>
  $ sudo gem install skynet
</pre>
<h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p>
Skynet works by putting &quot;tasks&quot; on a message queue which are
picked up by skynet workers, who execute the tasks, then put their results
back on the message queue. Skynet works best when it runs with your code.
For example, you might have a rails app and want some code you&#8216;ve
already written to run asynchronously or in a distributed way. Skynet can
run within your code by installing a skynet launcher into your app. Running
this skynet launcher within your app guarantees all skynet workers will
have access to your code. This will be covered later.
</p>
<p>
Skynet currently supports 2 message queue systems, TupleSpace and Mysql. By
default, the TupleSpace queue is used as it is the easiest to set up,
though it is less powerful and less scaleable for large installations.
</p>
<h2>RUNING SKYNET FOR THE FIRST TIME</h2>
<p>
Since Skynet is a distributed system, it requires you have a skynet message
queue as well as any number of skynet workers running. To start a skynet
message queue and a small number of workers:
</p>
<pre>
  $ skynet
</pre>
<p>
This starts a skynet tuple space message queue and 4 workers. You can now
run the skynet console to play with skynet a little. See <a
href="../classes/Skynet/ConsoleHelper.html">Skynet::ConsoleHelper</a> for
commands.
</p>
<pre>
  $ skynet console
</pre>
<p>
For help try:
</p>
<pre>
  $ skynet --help
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
  $ skynet console --help
</pre>
<p>
Here are some commands you can run in the skynet console.
</p>
<pre>
  &gt; stats
  &gt; manager.worker_pids
  &gt; [1,2,3,1,1,4].mapreduce(Skynet::MapreduceTest)
</pre>
<p>
That last command actually took whatever array you gave it and counted the
number of times each element appeared in the array. It&#8216;s not a very
useful task, but it shows how easy it is to use.
</p>
<p>
For more information on creating your own Skynet jobs read the <a
href="../classes/Skynet/Job.html">Skynet::Job</a> documentation.
</p>
<h2>RUNING SKYNET IN YOUR APPLICATION</h2>
<p>
To be really useful, you&#8216;ll want to run skynet in your own
application. To do that run:
</p>
<pre>
  $ skynet_install [--rails] [--mysql] YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY
</pre>
<p>
If you pass &#8212;rails it will assume it is installing in a rails app. If
you pass &#8212;mysql it will assume you are using the mysql as your
message queue.
</p>
<p>
Once it is installed in your application, you can run skynet with
</p>
<pre>
  $ ./script/skynet
  $ ./script/skynet console
</pre>
<p>
Now you can create your own Skynet jobs. Make sure to require your
libraries in your ./script/skynet BEFORE running skynet so that skynet can
use your code.
</p>
<h2>USAGE:</h2>
<p>
Skynet was designed to make doing easy things easy and hard things
possible. The easiest way to use skynet is to create a new class with a
self.map class method. You can optionally include self.reduce,
self.reduce_partitioner, self.map_partitioner as well. Each of those
methods should expect a single array (regardless of what data you pass).
Then, simple create an array and call mapreduce on it passing your class
name. Skynet will figure out which methods your class supports and use them
accordingly.
</p>
<h2>USING SKYNET IN RAILS</h2>
<p>
Skynet includes an addition to <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> that is very powerful.
</p>
<h3>distributed_find</h3>
<pre>
  $ YourModel.distributed_find(:all).each(YourClass)
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
  $ YourModel.distributed_find(:all).each(:somemethod)
</pre>
<p>
In the first example, a find is &#8216;virtually&#8217; run with your model
class, and the results are distributed to the skynet workers. If
you&#8216;ve implemented a self.map method in YourClass, the retrieved
objects will be passed (as arrays) on all the workers.
</p>
<p>
In the second example, once the objects of YourModel are distributed, each
worker merely calls :somemethod against each object.
</p>
<h3>send_later</h3>
<pre>
  $ model_object.send_later(:method,options,:save)
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes you have a method you want to call on a model asynchronously.
Using :send_later you can call a method, pass it options, and decide
whether you want Skynet to save that model or not once its done calling
your method.
</p>
<h2>Creating Skynet Jobs</h2>
<p>
The main interface to Skynet is through <a
href="../classes/Skynet/Job.html">Skynet::Job</a>
</p>
<pre>
  job = Skynet::Job.new(options)
  job.run
</pre>
<p>
There are many options you can pass or change once you have a job object.
See <a href="../classes/Skynet/Job.html">Skynet::Job</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time, you will only need to pass a map_reduce_class and
map_data. All other options just give you finer grain control. map_data
must be an array. The map_reduce_class must AT LEAST implement a self.map
class method. It may also implement self.reduce, self.reduce_partitioner,
and self.map_partitioner. Skynet will assume it can use all of those
methods in the map_reduce_class you pass.
</p>
<p>
Your map and reduce class methods should ALWAYS assume they are being
passed an array. Your map method must always return an array as well.
</p>
<h2>Skynet Logging</h2>
<pre>
  You might be interested in seeing what skynet is doing.  There are 2 Skynet::Config options which control logging.
  Skynet::CONFIG[:SKYNET_LOG_LEVEL] and Skynet::CONFIG[:SKYNET_LOG_FILE]
  Skynet::CONFIG[:SKYNET_LOG_LEVEL] is set to Logger::ERROR by default.  Other possibilities are Logger::DEBUG, Logger::INFO, Logger::WARN, Logger::ERROR, Logger::FATAL

  You might try Logger::INFO to see more of what's going on.  To use the Skynet::Logger inside your own classes simple
    include SkynetDebugger
</pre>
