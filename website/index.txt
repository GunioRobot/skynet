h2. What is Skynet

Skynet is an open source Ruby implementation of Google's Map/Reduce framework, created at Geni.com. With Skynet, one can easily convert a time-consuming serial task, such as a computationally expensive Rails migration, into a distributed program running on many computers.

Skynet is an adaptive, self-upgrading, fault-tolerant, and fully distributed system with no single point of failure. It uses a "peer recovery" system where workers watch out for each other. If a worker dies or fails for any reason, another worker will notice and pick up that task. Skynet also has no special 'master' servers, only workers which can act as a master for any task at any time. Even these master tasks can fail and will be picked up by other workers.

h2. Installing

Skynet can be installed via RubyGems:

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install skynet</pre>

h2. GETTING STARTED    

Skynet works by putting "tasks" on a message queue which are picked up by skynet workers, who execute the tasks, then put their results back on the message queue.   Skynet works best when it runs with your code.  For example, you might have a rails app and want some code you've already written to run asynchronously or in a distributed way.   Skynet can run within your code by installing a skynet launcher into your app.   Running this skynet launcher within your app guarantees all skynet workers will have access to your code.   This will be covered later.

Skynet currently supports 2 message queue systems, TupleSpace and Mysql.   By default, the TupleSpace queue is used as it is the easiest to set up, though it is less powerful and less scaleable for large installations.  

h2. RUNING SKYNET FOR THE FIRST TIME

Since Skynet is a distributed system, it requires you have a skynet message queue as well as any number of skynet workers running.  To start a skynet message queue and a small number of workers:

  $ skynet

This starts a skynet tuple space message queue and 4 workers.   You can now run the Skynet Console to play with skynet a little.

  $ skynet_console

Here are some commands you can run.  

  $ stats
  $ manager.worker_pids
  $ [1,2,3,1,1,4].mapreduce(Skynet::MapreduceTest)
  
That last command actually took whatever array you gave it and counted the number of times each element appeared in the array.  It's not a very useful task, but it shows how easy it is to use.

h2. RUNING SKYNET IN YOUR APPLICATION

To be really useful, you'll want to run skynet in your own application.   To do that run:

  $ skynet_install [--rails] YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY

If you pass --rails it will assume it is installing in a rails app.   Once it is installed in your application, you can run skynet with

  $ ./script/skynet
  $ ./script/skynet_console

h2. USAGE:

Skynet was designed to make doing easy things easy and hard things possible.   The easiest way to use skynet is to create a new class with a self.map class method.  You can optionally include self.reduce, self.reduce_partitioner, self.map_partitioner as well.  Each of those methods should expect a single array (regardless of what data you pass).   Then, simple create an array and call mapreduce on it passing your class name.   Skynet will figure out which methods your class supports and use them accordingly.

h2. USING SKYNET IN RAILS

Skynet includes a few additions to ActiveRecord that are very powerful.

h3. distributed_find


  $ YourModel.distributed_find(:all).each(YourClass)

or

  $ YourModel.distributed_find(:all).each(:somemethod)
  
In the first example, a find is 'virtually' run with your model class, and the results are distributed to the skynet workers.  If you've implemented a self.map method in YourClass, the retrieved objects will be passed (as arrays) on all the workers.

In the second example, once the objects of YourModel are distributed, each worker merely calls :somemethod against each object.

h3. send_later

  $ model_object.send_later(:method,options,:save)
  
Sometimes you have a method you want to call on a model asynchronously.  Using :send_later you can call a method, pass it options, and decide whether you want Skynet to save that model or not once its done calling your method.

h2. Creating Skynet Jobs

The main interface to Skynet is through Skynet::AsyncJob or Skynet::Job

  job = Skynet::AsyncJob.new(options)
  job.run_master
  
There are many options you can pass or change once you have a job object.

  :map_data
  :map_reduce_class
  :name
  :map_name
  :reduce_name
  :master                
  :async                 
  :solo                  
  :single
  :version
  :map_tasks
  :reduce_tasks
  :map_timeout
  :reduce_timeout
  :master_timeout
  :result_timeout
  :start_after
  :master_result_timeout
  
Most of the time, you will only need to pass a map_reduce_class and map_data.  All other options just give you finer grain control.   map_data must be an array.   The map_reduce_class must AT LEAST implement a self.map class method.  It may also implement self.reduce, self.reduce_partitioner, and self.map_partitioner.  Skynet will assume it can use all of those methods in the map_reduce_class you pass.

Your map and reduce class methods should ALWAYS assume they are being passed an array.  Your map method must always return an array as well.
